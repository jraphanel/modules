Variants
========

Configuration
-------------

- Variant mechanism requires the :mconfig:`advanced_version_spec` option to be enabled

    - Variants can be seen as an extension of the advanced module version specifiers


Specification
-------------

Defining
^^^^^^^^

- variants are defined for modulefiles within concerned modulefiles with the :mfcmd:`variant` modulefile command

    - variants are bound to the modulefile their target
    - especially modulefile evaluation may be guided by the value selected for the variants
    - so it makes more sense to have variants defined within modulefiles rather in modulercs

- ``variant --default? defaultval? --multivalued? --alias? {aliasname...?} name value ...?``

- ``name`` restrained to the accepted variable name

    - which should correspond to a sequence of one or more characters that are a letter, digit or underscore
    - if we want to match Spack here also: ``[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*``
    - raise error otherwise

- a variant ``name`` that has already been defined as variant or variant alias for this modulefile evaluation overwrites previous definition

    - it is up to modulefile author to ensure there is no duplicate
    - no need this way to check in ``modulecmd.tcl`` code if variant has already been defined

- may have a default value (when ``--default`` argument is passed)

    - if not, variant is undefined
    - argument ``--default`` should be associated a *defaultval* argument

        - raise error otherwise

    - default value should be part of possible value list

        - error is raised otherwise when default value is used, as it does not correspond to an accepted value

            - ex: ``variant name --default 1.8 1.0 2.0``

- may be multi-valued (when ``--multivalued`` argument is passed)

    - if so a list is set with selected values

- must have a list of accepted values

    - passed value(s) must correspond to those accepted

        - raise error otherwise
        - raised error is a global error to signal specification issue, not a modulefile error

- may be aliased (when argument ``--alias`` is passed) in which case:

    - argument ``--alias`` should be associated one or a list of alias names

        - raise error otherwise

    - defined alias names should be valid variant name (i.e.: ``[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*``)

        - raise error otherwise

    - should not be already defined as variant or variant alias

        -  raise error otherwise

    - variant alias could negate its target (when alias name is prefixed by ``-``)

        - meaning if alias variant is set to ``false`` its target is set to ``true``
        - only possible if targeted variant is Boolean

            - raise error otherwise

        - no support of ``~`` as an alternative negated prefix to only get one way to write negation

- require a value to be set

    - raise error if no value set for variant (no value specified and no defined default)

- to validate variant value is coherent against other variant values or any other test

    - it is up to the modulefile author to write the appropriate test after all variant declaration
    - and then raise error if variant combination is not appropriate
    - as there is no way to automatically determine when all variants are declared


Evaluating
^^^^^^^^^^

- when reaching ``variant`` command in modulefile

- set a key ``name`` in array ``ModuleVariant`` if variant ``name`` has been specified or if it owns a default value

    - variable ``ModuleVariant($name)`` is not defined if variant not specified and no default for it

        - error is raised if used in this case

- if variant ``name`` can be aliased, if alias is set it specifies the value of variant ``name``

    - evaluated from left to right, in case variant is set and also its aliases
    - negating aliases sets its reversed value to Boolean variant

- variant alias is not instantiated in ``ModuleVariant`` array

    - therefore accessing ``$ModuleVariant($aliasname)`` will raise an error

- raise error if variant ``name``:

    - has been specified but passed value is incorrect
    - is single-valued but multiple values are passed
    - is wrongly declared in modulefile

- then variable ``$ModuleVariant(name)`` could be used to adapt modulefile evaluation

- to know all variant currently set, use ``[array names ModuleVariant]``

    - but beware that only the variant already evaluated will be set in array
    - must use after all the ``variant`` to be set in the modulefile to accurately get all variant defined

- if variant accepted values are Booleans, variable could be directly used in conditional tests

    - like ``if {$ModuleVariant($name)} {...``

- quoting Tcl doc, Booleans could have many forms:

    - If string is any of *0*, *false*, *no*, or *off*, then Tcl_GetBoolean stores a zero value at ``*boolPtr``.
    - If string is any of *1*, *true*, *yes*, or *on*, then 1 is stored at ``*boolPtr``.
    - Any of these values may be abbreviated, and upper-case spellings are also acceptable

- variants with a :ref:`shortcut <variant-shortcut>` defined for them, are resolved to their full name and transmitted this way to the modulefile

    - therefore no entry in ``ModuleVariant`` array is made for the shortcut name

- special variant ``version`` is instanciated as variable ``ModuleVariant(version)`` if declared

    - will be set to value that may be specified with the ``@`` shortcut
    - will initially work as any other variant (accepted list of value, default value)

        - using ``variant version --default 1.8 1.8 1.10``
        - is equivalent of having two modulefiles *mod/1.8* and *mod/1.10*
        - with a default defined: ``module-version mod/1.8 default``

    - FUTURE: could be refined later on to accept range then select latest version or defined default if in range
    - note that ``ModuleVariant(version)`` is set only if a ``version`` variant is declared in modulefile
    - querying ``[module-info name]`` returns modulefile designation appended by the version variant: ``@versionvalue``

- at the end of the modulefile evaluation, if module specification contains a variant which is not defined in modulefile

    - an error is raised

- for the different evaluation modes:

    - *load*, *display*, *help* and *test* applies evaluation mechanism described above

        - for the *display*, *help* and *test* modes it helps to see how the modulefile reacts to the different variant value
        - on *display* mode, the ``variant`` command is reported in addition of its evaluation

    - *unload* evaluates the mechanism described above but the specified variants are fetched from loaded module persistent information

        - ``version`` variant value is fetched from the module specification to identify the module to unload
        - other variant specification on the unload command are dropped once matching loaded module is identified
        - which means the specification recorded corresponds to the one from the loaded module

            - as a consequence ``[module-info specified]`` returns the loaded module specification and not the specification defined on the ``module unload`` command

        - variant values are defined within modulefile context by the evaluation of the ``variant`` modulefile commands

            - like it is done during a *load* modulefile evaluation
            - this way variables related to variant are instantiated the same way whether module is loading or unloading
            - so it is easier for modulefile author to understand how the modulefile code is evaluated

        - variant evaluated during modulefile unload may produce an error

            - if variant value not found defined or if value recorded in persistency does not match an allowed value
            - should encourage variants to be consistent between the load and unload evaluation phases

    - *whatis* ignores all variants from the module specification (only the module names are retained)

        - like for ``setenv`` or ``*-path`` modulefile commands on this mode, ``variant`` will set the ``ModuleVariant`` array with a empty string for each variant defined in the modulefile
        - this is done to avoid the *undefined variable* error if these variables are used later in the modulefile
        - FUTURE: if the different ``version`` variant values are considered as different modulefiles in the future, then *whatis* may evaluates the ``version`` variant from module specification


Persistency
^^^^^^^^^^^

- once a module is loaded its defined variants are made persistent in user environment

    - to keep track of how loaded modules were evaluated
    - and enable query commands on these loaded modules without need to reevaluate modulefile

- variants defined are made persistent in :envvar:`MODULES_LMVARIANT` environment variable

    - following same approach than for :envvar:`MODULES_LMPREREQ`
    - each loaded module with defined variants (default value or specifically set) will expose these variants value in a record with following syntax:

        - ``loadedmodule&(+|-)boolvariantname1&variantname2|value2|value3...``

    - each *loadedmodule* record are joined in ``MODULES_LMVARIANT`` separated by ``:`` character

- variant alias are also made persistent in :envvar:`MODULES_LMVARIANTALTNAME` environment variable

    - each loaded module with defined variants (default value or specifically set) which could be aliased will expose their aliases in a record with following syntax

        - ``loadedmodule&variantname1|aliasname1|-aliasname2&variant2|aliasname3...``

    - each loadedmodule record are joined in ``MODULES_LMVARIANTALTNAME`` separated by ``:`` character

- Boolean variants are stored in the form ``+name`` or ``-name``

    - which enables to determine this variant is of Boolean type
    - and check against query using different Boolean representations

        - like ``serial=0``, ``serial=on``, ``serial=false``, etc.

- when the special variant ``version`` is defined for a loaded module

    - the value of this variant is part of loaded module identification
    - ``@versionvalue`` is appended to the module name, for instance ``mod@1.2``
    - such identification is then recorded in persistency variables to designate loaded module (like ``LOADEDMODULES``, ``MODULES_LMPREREQ``, ``MODULES_LMVARIANT``, etc)
    - this way in case a modulefile allows the load of two of its versions in the user environment, it is possible to distinguish these two loaded versions (to unload one of them for instance)
    - with this identification, it is possible to distinguish a traditional module (identified by ``mod/version``) from a module using ``version`` variant (identified by ``mod@version``)
    - note that if a modulefile ``mod/1.2`` defines a ``version`` variant, it will be identified as ``mod/1.2@versionvalue``

        - so the ``version`` variant should not be defined if each version of the module has its own modulefile
        - ``version`` variant is useful if a single modulefile is used to instantiate every version of the module

    - FUTURE: when it will be possible to override the shortcut for ``version`` variant it will be important to identify version value in loaded module identification string
      with a designation that is not dependent of the selected shortcut

- loaded module identification stops at the module name and ``version`` variant (if defined)

    - other variants are not considered as part of the identification
    - as it is not foreseen useful to have the same module loaded multiple times with different variant values, unless for ``version`` variant


Specifying
^^^^^^^^^^

- following Spack spec

    - see https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/lib/spack/spack/spec.py
    - or https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#variants
    - this specs covers all needs to specify variant on Modules
    - Spack users are already familiar with it,
    - it copes very well with command-line typing, avoiding most problematic characters

        - that are interpreted by shells (like < or >)

    - specification for one module could

        - be almost condensed into one word *hdf5@1.8+debug*
        - or be expanded into multiple *hdf5 @1.8 +debug*

- same grammar used whatever the context

    - command-line or as argument to modulefile command (like command)

- variants are specified whether

    - as specific words (separated by " ")
    - or as suffix to module name

- change command specifications which were previously accepting list of modules

    - like *module1 module2 module3*
    - now these modules could express variants appended to their name

        - like *module1@1.8+debug module2~shared module3*

    - or these variants could be defined as words next to module name

        - like *module1@1.8 +debug module2 shared=false module3*

    - as a consequence it denies:

        - use of *+*, *~* and *=* in module names
        - and use of *-* as first character of module names

    - also a command-line argument starting with the *-* character is not anymore considered as an invalid option

        - it is considered as an element of the module specification (potential negated boolean variant)
        - unless if set prior the sub-command designation

    - such change requires an option to be enabled to avoid breaking compat

        - this is why to enable variant, the ``advanced_version_spec`` option has to be enabled

- a valued-variant is specified by *name=value*

    - this kind of variant cannot be directly appended to module name
    - thus it must be specified as a separate word
    - in case variant can be multi-valued, a ``,`` character separates each value to set

- a Boolean variant can be specified with its bare name prefixed by *+*, *-* or *~*

    - when directly appended to module name string (no space) only *+* and *~* are recognized

        - *-* in this case is retained as part of previous name/value

    - the negation prefix *-* is not supported on the :command:`ml` command

        - as this *-* prefix means to unload a module on this command

    - negation prefix plus Boolean variant name should not equal a command-line option short form

        - command-line option takes precedence
        - for instance the ``-t`` will always be treated as ``--terse`` and not the negation of a ``t`` variant

    - beware that the negation prefix *~* when used as a separate word may trigger the tilda resolution of the currently running shell

        - if a username matches a Boolean variant name, using the ``~name`` form on the shell command-line will leads to the resolution of the HOME directory path of user ``name``

    - Boolean variant could also be specified using the *name=value* form

        - in which case, it should be written as a separate word
        - value could be any syntax recognized as a true or false string

            - false: *0*, *false*, *no*, or *off*
            - true: *1*, *true*, *yes*, or *on*
            - Any of these values may be abbreviated, and upper-case spellings are also acceptable.

- variant may be specified with a shortcut if any set (see :ref:`variant-shortcut`)

    - a shortcut is appended to the module designation word or specified as separate word, combined or not with other variant

        - for instance for the ``@`` shortcut: *module@versspec+boolvar*, *module+boolvar@versspec*, *module +boolvar@versspec*

    - even if a shortcut is set, the variant could also be expressed as valued variant name

- in case variant is specified multiple times

    - lastly mentioned (read from left to right) value is retained (it overwrites previous values)

        - a *merge all passed values in list* is not the methodology retained here

            - to offer only one way to specify multiple values for a variant
            - same handling way whatever the variant properties
            - as prior modulefile evaluation, variant properties are unknown (single or multi valued?)

    - like *name=value1 name=value2*

        - or *name=value name=value*
        - or *name=value1,value2 name=value3*
        - or *name=value1 name=value2,value3*
        - or *@vers1 version=vers2*
        - or for boolean *+name~name*
        - or *~name -name*
        - or *~name name=value1 name=value2,value3*
        - or in case of variant aliases *+name~aliastoname*

    - at the specification time variant aliases are not known

        - so the full module specification has to be transmitted toward the modulefile to determine what is the value at the most right position
        - for instance *name=value1 aliasname=value2* with *aliasname* being an alias of *name*
        - specification can just be cleared from the obvious duplicates (same variant name defined multiple times on the line)

- when special characters like *?* or \* are used in variant name or value

    - they are treated literally, no wildcard meaning is applied
    - like currently done when specifying module version on command-line

        - which leads to errors as no corresponding module is found::

            $ module load loc_dv6/*
            ERROR: Unable to locate a modulefile for 'loc_dv6/*'

- when a variant is specified but it does not correspond to a variant defined in the evaluated modulefile

    - an error is raised at the end of modulefile evaluation
    - need to wait for the end of modulefile evaluation to be sure the variant is defined nowhere in modulefile code

- special variant ``version`` has to be specified with ``@`` shortcut or by its full variant name (``version=value``)

    - traditional separator character ``/`` cannot be used to specify variant version
    - if used, a modulefile named ``mod/version`` will be searched and a *module not found* error will be raised

- specification may be passed to commands to verify a given module and variant combination is loaded

    - which should be performed without evaluating modulefiles
    - like for ``is-loaded`` sub-command:

        - ``module is-loaded hdf5+parallel``
        - or ``hdf5@1.8 parallel=true``
        - or ``hdf5 -serial``
        - or ``hdf5 serial=0``

    - checks rely on the content of the ``MODULES_LMVARIANT`` and ``MODULES_LMVARIANTALTNAME`` variables

        - which store variants set for loaded modules and eventual variant aliases of variant set

    - with this information it is possible to compare query against what is loaded

        - a variant specified on query which is not part of the variables means a different module/variant combination

            - even if variant from query is not valid for module, which cannot be known

    - verification mechanism of a sub-command like ``is-loaded`` should be preserved

        - which means a query not mentioning a specific value for a variant should match a loaded module which specify a variant value that differs from this variant default

    - the module identification part in specification may be resolved from a symbolic version or a module alias to an actual modulefile

- the ``@loaded`` specification is translated into the name, version and variant list of corresponding loaded module

    - for instance ``mod/3.0 foo=val1`` is loaded so ``mod@loaded`` is translated into ``mod/3.0 foo=val1``
    - in case the ``@loaded`` specification is followed by variant specified, those variant specifications are ignored
    - following the above example, ``mod@loaded foo=val2`` is translated into ``mod/3.0 foo=val1``


.. _variant-shortcut:

Variant shortcut
""""""""""""""""

- shortcuts can be set to abbreviate variant names and simplify their specification

    - a shortcut abbreviates ``name=`` into a unique character
    - when using shortcut, variant value is specified as ``<shortcut>value``
    - for instance, if the ``%`` is set as the shortcut for a ``toolchain`` variant, value ``foss21a`` is specified as ``%foss21a``

- shortcut can be set through the :mconfig:`variant_shortcut` configuration option

    - this option holds a colon separated list of shortcut definitions
    - each definition have the following form: ``variantname=shortcut_character``
    - for instance: ``toolchain=%:foo=^``

- shortcut must be:

    - a single character
    - excluding characters already used for other concerns or in module names (*-*, *+*, *~*, */*, *@*, *=*, *[a-zA-Z0-9]*)
    - when set through ``config`` sub-command or ``--with-variant-shortcut`` installation option: an error is raised when a shortcut is badly specified
    - if a badly specified shortcut ends up in modulecmd configuration, it is purely ignored

- shortcut does not apply to Boolean variants

    - as shortcuts are intended to be a prefix, they cannot combine with *-*, *+* or *~* Boolean prefixes

- by default, when ``advanced_version_spec`` is enabled, the ``@`` character is set as a shortcut for the ``version`` variant

    - this shortcut is not referred in ``MODULES_VARIANT_SHORTCUT`` thus it cannot be unset
    - FUTURE: superseding of this ``@`` shortcut in ``MODULES_VARIANT_SHORTCUT`` may be introduced in the future

        - but currently entries in ``MODULES_VARIANT_SHORTCUT`` for ``version`` variant are ignored

- variant shortcuts could be used on the command-line or within modulefiles even if it is not recommended to use them in the latter case

    - as if user updates the ``variant_shortcut`` configuration option, it will broke underlying modulefiles using a de-configured shortcuts
